    abstract = {{Abstract The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global information space comprising linked documents. As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct access to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is based around two main themes - the publication and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application development, research or further study.

    abstract = {{The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting
structured data on the Web. These best practices have been adopted by an increasing
number of data providers over the last three years, leading to the creation of a global data
space containing billions of assertions - the Web of Data. In this article we present the
concept and technical principles of Linked Data, and situate these within the broader context
of related technological developments. We describe progress to date in publishing Linked
Data on the Web, review applications that have been developed to exploit the Web of Data,
and map out a research agenda for the Linked Data community as it moves forward.}},
